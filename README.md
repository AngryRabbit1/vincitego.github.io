  * refactor combat log output to read and flow better
  * improve gui (incorporate icons?)
  
  
Hero Mechanics:
  * TBD as heroes are implemented
  * Carrie
    + Dodge, is it all or nothing? Do basics or actives that do multiple attacks dodge all or is each attack evaulated separately? Ex: Garuda.
    + Her percent attack per energy is true damage?
    + Is this reduced by all damage reduce?
  * Tara
    + What does seal of light actually seal?
    + On death effects seem to still work
    + Basic attack modifications seem to still work
    + Passive stat modifications seem to still work
    + Seems to only affect passives that are triggered by an event (aside from on death)?
    + Seal can't be removed by purify
  * Amen-Ra
    + Do her shields block ticks of a dot from an active?
    + Can you crit/block against an active shield?
  * Aida
    + Does final verdict passive still happen if under cc?
  * Belrain
    + Does her speed buff change order of attack? Or is that determined at the beginning of the round and won't affect order until next round?
  * Horus
    + can you block while cc'ed?
    + does his crimsom contract passive work through seal of light and cc?
    + does his active proc both if there is only a front line or only a back line?
    + what does guaranteed crit strike damage mean?
    + attacks front line even though none of his skills say so?
  * Dark Arthindol
    + Buff seems to trigger only once per instance of taking damage
  * Unimax
    + Is the attack steal against base attack or total attack? Is is then added to his base attack? or is it a flat bonus?
  * Delacium
    + What is considered a unique debuff? Is a skill that applies 2 effects considered 2 debuffs or one?
  * Ithaqua
    + How does ghost possessed interact with taunt?
    + Does ghost possessed trigger other hero's on active abilities?
  * Elyvia
    + Is all damage taken a different stat than all damage reduce?
    + is the speed exchange a buff/debuff effect?
    

Mechanics:
  * Order of applying attack and hp percent modifiers
    + they seem to be applied by first adding all constant modifers together
    + then applying percentage modifiers one source at a time in a specific order 
    + with a math.floor in between
    + current best guess on order: enable level bonus, enable selected skills, equipment, set bonus, skin, guild tech, passive, artifact, stone
  * Leveling
    + base stats are different at 5*, 6*, and 10*
    + increases by usually 10% of base stats per level, some stats for some heroes grow at a different rate
    + except speed, speed increases a flat 2 per level
    + each tier adds an additive percentage bonus to stats
    + 20% for hp and attack, 10% for speed
    + enabling adds a multiplier for attack (10%) and hp (14%) per enable level
    + this multiplier affects other sources of attack and hp
  * HP % damage
    + ignores armor
    + affected by block?
    + ignores damage reduce
    + affected by holy damage?
    + ignores skill damage
    + ignores precision
    + ignores crit
  * Armor
    + damage mitigation = armor / (180 + 20*level)
  * Block
    + 30% reduced normal damage, 44% reduced crit damage
    + chance of crit and chance of block seem to use the same roll
    + can you block while CC'ed?
  * Precision
    + each percent reduces enemy block and adds 0.3% damage 
    + max bonus damage capped at 45%
  * Holy Damage
    + 1% holy damage add 0.7% damage
    + ignores armor
  * Crit Damage
    + 50% extra damage based
    + Add 2% damage per 1% of crit damage stat
  * Energy
    + attack: 50, get hit: 10, get crit: 20
  * Skill Damage
    + additive to damage in skill description, not multiplicative
    + each energy over 100 adds 1% skill damage
    + does not affect hp% based or dot damage
  * Damage calculation
    + unlike stat calculations, damage appears to be rounded instead of floored.
    + abilities that do further calculations on this number use the true unrounded number. See baade.
    + another possibility is that baades damage is calculated as a single block but his extra damage only triggers if the "normal" damage wouldn't kill the target
  * How does global cc immunity interact with cc specific immunity?
    + multiplicative?
  * How does global damage reduce interact with class specific damage reduce?
    + multiplicative?
  * Heal effect and effect being healed
    + is hp% healing affected by these stats?
  * Monster 
    + energy +20 at end of round, +10 on ally active
    + active does true damage
    + excess energy does not increase damage of active
    + static attack and hp buff, how does it work?
    + monsters act at end of turn before buffs and debuffs tick
    + which means their buffs/debuffs last one round less than stated, dots still do full damage
    + first tick of dot happens right away, then debuffs tick, that's 2 rounds worth of dots that occur at the end of the turn
  * Buffs/debuffs
    + currently applying percent buff debuffs using rounding to match the calculate damage, but should they be fully recalculated using floor in between each application?
    + do buffs tick first, then debuffs?
    + can you die in the middle of a buff/debuff resolution if there's a heal buff on the "stack"?
  * Enable3 skills
    + do they trigger before or after buffs/debuffs tick?
    + does purify remove an entire stack of debuffs?
  * Enable5 skills
    + does balanced strike count as a separate source of attack?
    + unbending will: is this a buff that can be cleansed? ie by Gustin
