Unknowns:
  - Exact method of applying attack and hp percent modifiers. They seem to be applied by
    first adding all static modifers together and then applying percentage modifiers
    one source at a time with a math.floor in between. But the numbers are very slightly off.
  - How much does armor stat reduce damage?
  - Can a crit be blocked?
